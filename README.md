# MauiTwitter
.NET MAUI shell can be used to design the Navigation experience app for your App. 
I tried the new MAUI Shell navigation by creating a Twitter Clone. I started by creating the Flyout experience on Twitter.

This is just XAML UX code and does not contain the services or data models etc.

However, I had to stop in between as I could not implement both Tabs and Flyout at the same time because of a platform limitation\feature discussed here-

I also faced few other issues like below.
* Not able to change the Hamburger icon to image.
* Issue with font icons 

Will revisit it after sometime to fix the UI and add Home Feed view.
